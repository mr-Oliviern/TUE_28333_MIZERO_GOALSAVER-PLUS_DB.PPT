 ## 5. One-Page Explanation 

GoalSaver Plus – Phase II: Business Process Modeling

This phase focuses on modeling the savings deposit and interest workflow. The process begins when a customer submits a deposit, which is then validated by the Automated PL/SQL System. Valid deposits are recorded in the ledger and the customer's balance is updated. A scheduled component applies interest based on saving duration and system-defined rules. After interest posting, the system evaluates the customer’s loan eligibility automatically.
