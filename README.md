 ## 📌 Project Overview

GoalSaver Plus is a Savings & Loan Management Information System (MIS) built using Oracle Database + PL/SQL.
It supports member savings accounts, loan applications, repayments, transaction monitoring, and business intelligence analytics.

This project follows 8 structured phases, covering full system development from problem definition to BI dashboards and final documentation.
